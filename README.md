## Community Presence and Visibility

Data Science communities are extremely critical since it creates a platform for Data Scientists to collaborate, share and learn many aspects in the process.

Focus on few dimensions:
- Explore Datasets, Leverage by industry, by function based your specific need
- Create Notebooks or Kernels using Datasets, Use Cases
- Active participation in Discussions
- Participate and experience in Competitions
- Write Blogs, Point of Views
- Presence on Publications, Patents
- Build thought leadership (for senior roles/practitioners) on an ongoing basis

### Key 10 Forums for Data Scientists to start venturing into:

- [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com)
- [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
- [Codalab](https://codalab.org/)
- [Machine Hack](https://machinehack.com/)
- [IBM Data Science Community](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/home)
- [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)
- [Tianchi Global from Alibaba](https://tianchi-global.com/home/)
- [Youth4work](https://www.youth4work.com/)
- [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/)
- [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/)

This is just a non-exhaustive list and representation for learning purposes. However, we personally recommend building some time on any one or multiple platform(s) and learn over a period of time by demonstrating capability around that.

### Recommended Outcomes to Plan

- Target to write 1 blogs every quarter on forums such as Medium
- Ability to read, digest and understand research papers / publication papers within 1 yr of learning Data Science skills
- Try to move from Novice to Contributor within 1-2 weeks in Kaggle, and then to Expert level in Kaggle within few months depending your time and participation. Key is to be regular and then continuously learn
- 1-2 Patents or Publications within 2 yrs into Data Science field


### Involvement in other Quorums

- [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)
- [Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/)
- [Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)
